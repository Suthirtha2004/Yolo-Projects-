# 🧠 YOLO-Based Object Detection Projects

This repository contains a collection of object detection projects built using **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).  
Each project is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** for easy experimentation and visualization.
